# The JSON Schema form repository

Welcome to the JSON schema form repository!
You will find the schemas in the /schemas folder, and soon also forms in the /forms-folder.
There are partially resolved schemas in the /schemas/resolved folder.

You may notice that many schemas look like they are generated from schema.org definitions. 
That is because they are, they are based on the latest schema.org RDF, currently in the /releases/2.2/all-layers.nq-file.
